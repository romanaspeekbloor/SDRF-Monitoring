# SDRF-Monitoring
Monitoring the RF spectum using SDR's
Wideband RF 


Who – us 

What - RF spectrum mapping

Why - Recording comparative signal strength - monitoring power to frequency’s

When - End Feb for first station

Where - locations along Deptford creek; from Creek mouth through to 
Brookmill Park, Birdsnest, APT, Faircharm, Goldsmiths building on the 
Creek island? Hoy steps, CDC, Old Joinery, Ha'penny Hatch Laban

RTL Power

Using the software RTL power, we generated a heatmap that showed the energy used for that frequency. RTL Power is based in the Linux command line and outputs a .csv file which can then be transformed in to the waterfall 

Listening to aeroplanes and mapping the pilot voices to the planes 
Played around with virtual radar server and added filters like military aircraft and saw some on the map.
Listening in to London city airport control tower and tried to link the voices to the plains but we could not see the planes on the map as there was a building in the way so we uses flightradar24
Install virtual radar along with RTL 1090 to receive ads-b (plane location data)
Using GQRX to tune in to the frequency for London city airport control tower which is______.

Things that went wrong
We could not actually see the airplanes landing at London city airport on the map.
Installing virtual radar on Linux.

Expanding the RF range

Getting it to work like one of our USB DVB SDR’s (no luck)

Gamma RF

https://www.gammarf.io/

We found this software that runs off Linux. The software listen to RF using an SDR dongle and plots the data in to graphs which is then viewable on the website.

We had no luck with this as it needed docker and we are not experienced enough to understand how to overcome this.
